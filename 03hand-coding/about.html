        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Olivia, and I like movies.</p>

        <p>Over the nearly three decades of my life I have carefully collected and curated my very favorite films into
            a list of the top ten. Most of the time I say that the list is in “somewhat particular order”, mostly
            because I absolutely hate putting some of them above others, as they have all shaped me. I say this as a
            precursor so that you may know that although the top 10 on this site is in a set ranking, the place that
            these movies have on my list usually fluctuate depending on on the day, mood, and amount of sleep I’ve had.
        </p>

        <h2>Honorable Mentions</h2>
        <p>I’d like to take just a moment to highlight and acknowledge a few of the movies that are very dear to my
            heart that didn’t quite make the cut this time, although they either have in the past or occasionally make
            an appearance in the top 10 list. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Birds <em>(1963)</em></li>
            <li>Shrek 2 <em>(2004)</em></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Favorite Directors</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt><strong>Edgar Wright</strong></dt>
            <dd>My all-time favorite director is responsible for two of the movies on my top ten list. His shot framing,
                punchy edits, pacing, curated soundtracks and color profiles are what makes him the very best.</dd>
            <dt><strong>Alfred Hitchcock</strong></dt>
            <dd>One of the greats that has contributed more to cinema than anyone else. His style, visual storytelling,
                and elaborately crafted shots have inspired generations of filmmakers. </dd>
            <dt><strong>Wes Anderson</strong></dt>
            <dd>Wes is a favorite of mine for the exact same reasons Edgar Wright is, which show that I have a defined
                taste.</dd>
