    <h1>Declaration of Independence</h1>
    <h2>What it Says</h2>
    <p>We hold these truths to be <strong>self-evident</strong>, that all men are <em>created equal</em>, that they are
        endowed
        by their Creator
        with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to
        secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the
        governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the
        People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and
        organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.
        Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient
        causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are
        sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train
        of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute
        Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for
        their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity
        which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great
        Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an
        absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.</p>
    <p>In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated
        Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act
        which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.</p>

    <h2>Why we are upset</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.</li>
        <li>He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their
            operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to
            them.</li>
    </ol>
